# fly-cat_chrome-extension
This is  a chrome extension which inserts a div at the top of any webpage that loads and displays a random quote pulled using a rest API, displays cat animation, and changes webpage background colors. 

Thanks to Jay, and everyone else at Pair Columbus (paircolumbus.org) who demonstrated how to utilize APIs to pull data on the fly like this exstension does!

You can download the chrome extension from the chrome store here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fly-cat-webpage-awesome-i/lhacmlbiebecfkckbdjoloefmccgpnpi
